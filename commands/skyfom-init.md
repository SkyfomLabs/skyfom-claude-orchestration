# Skyfom Project Initialization

You are running the Skyfom project initialization command. Your task is to guide the user through creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) by asking interactive questions and generating a well-structured document.

## Process Overview

1. Check if PRD.md already exists in .claude folder
2. Ask 4 rounds of questions to collect project information
3. Generate a comprehensive PRD document
4. Save to `.claude/PRD.md`
5. Provide confirmation and next steps

## Step 1: Check for Existing PRD

First, use the Read tool to check if `.claude/PRD.md` already exists in the current working directory. If it does, inform the user and ask if they want to overwrite it using AskUserQuestion with options "Overwrite" and "Cancel".

## Step 2: Collect Information

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to collect information in 4 rounds. For each round, ask thoughtful questions that will help create a comprehensive PRD.

### Round 1: Project Overview
Ask the user for:
- Project name
- Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- Vision/mission statement
- Top 3-5 project goals

Present these as text input questions. You may structure this as a single AskUserQuestion call with clear question prompts.

### Round 2: Target Users & Features
Ask the user for:
- Target users/personas (who will use this product?)
- Core features (list 5-10 key features)
- Functional requirements (what must the system do?)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.)

### Round 3: Technical Stack
Ask the user for their technology preferences:
- Frontend technologies (provide options: React, Vue, Svelte, Other)
- Backend technologies (provide options: Node.js/TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go)
- Database preferences (provide options: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Other)
- Infrastructure/deployment (provide options: AWS, Docker/Kubernetes, Cloudflare, Other)

Use the options format for these questions to make it easier for users to select.

### Round 4: Success Metrics & Timeline
Ask the user for:
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) - how will success be measured?
- Project milestones (what are the key phases?)
- MVP timeline expectations
- Any specific constraints or dependencies

## Step 3: Generate PRD Document

Once you have all the information, generate a comprehensive PRD document using this structure:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: [Project Name]

*Generated: [Current Date]*
*Generated by: Skyfom Init Command*

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Project Name
[Project name from user input]

### Description
[Description from user input]

### Vision
[Vision/mission statement from user input]

### Goals
[List the goals provided by user, formatted as bullet points]

---

## 2. Target Users & Features

### Target Users
[Describe the target users/personas]

### Core Features
[List the core features as bullet points]

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
[List functional requirements]

#### Non-Functional Requirements
[List non-functional requirements like performance, security, etc.]

---

## 3. Technical Stack

### Frontend
[Frontend technologies selected]

### Backend
[Backend technologies selected]

### Database
[Database preferences]

### Infrastructure & Deployment
[Infrastructure/deployment approach]

### Third-party Services
[Any third-party services or APIs mentioned]

---

## 4. Success Metrics & Timeline

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
[List the KPIs that will measure success]

### Project Milestones
[Describe the key milestones and phases]

### Timeline
- **MVP Delivery**: [Expected MVP timeline]
- **Full Release**: [Expected full release timeline]

### Constraints & Dependencies
[Any specific constraints or dependencies mentioned]

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine this PRD with stakeholders
2. Use `/skyfom-orchestrate` to break down work into tasks
3. Begin development with Skyfom agent team
4. Track progress and update PRD as needed

---

*This document should be treated as a living document and updated throughout the project lifecycle.*
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Use the Write tool to save the generated PRD to `/Volumes/Startup/WeAsAn/.claude/PRD.md`.

## Step 5: Confirmation

After successfully creating the PRD, inform the user:

"Your Product Requirements Document has been successfully created at `.claude/PRD.md`!

Next steps:
- Review the PRD and make any necessary adjustments
- Share it with your team for feedback
- Use `/skyfom-orchestrate` to start breaking down the work
- Begin development with the Skyfom agent team

Good luck with your project!"

**Important Notes:**
- Be conversational and friendly throughout the process
- If users provide minimal information, gently encourage them to be more specific
- Adapt the questions based on their responses (e.g., if they mention mobile app, ask about iOS/Android)
- Keep the PRD well-formatted and professional
- Use markdown formatting effectively (headers, lists, bold, etc.)
